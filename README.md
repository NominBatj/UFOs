# UFOs
Project using JavaScript and Bootstrap.


## Overview of the Project

The aim of the project is to create a website that displays a dynamic table of UFO sightings. The page contains a formula for entering and filtering data. The website was created using HTML for the basic structure and Bootstrap to control the appearance of the site. This website contains a dataset from where users can extract information filtered by various criteria.

## Results

We redesigned the website which originally displayed information based on any random data. Now it allows users to search by criteria based on four more elements: city, state, country, and shape, and use the home button to reload the website.

Here are some results:

First, the Home button (UFO Sightings) has the capability to reload the website and clear the search buttons.

Second, The search filter has been updated to include four more elements that can be used independently.

Last, since we updated many features there, the information is presented in a clean and organized way.
